# MultiGame

About this project. It's an API that allows you to create multiple minigame arenas to play on a single Minecraft server, allowing for much less RAM compared to other ways to create minigames. This API is fully functional, although there are some issues. This is open to show some of my knowledge and capabilities.

This is not my only project, there are other projects as well. But if you need to see them, please contact me personally (email: bezfors@gmail.com).
